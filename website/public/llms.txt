# crib

> Dev containers without the ceremony. A CLI tool that reads .devcontainer configs, builds the container, and gets out of the way. Supports Docker and Podman.

crib is a devcontainer CLI tool. It reads `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configs, builds the container (image-based, Dockerfile-based, or Docker Compose-based), and manages the full lifecycle: creating, starting, stopping, rebuilding, and removing dev containers. No agents, no SSH, no IDE integration, just the CLI.
