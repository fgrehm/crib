import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick Start

```
cd my-project
crib up        # build and start the devcontainer
crib shell     # drop into a shell
crib restart   # restart (picks up config changes)
crib down      # stop and remove the container
crib remove    # remove container and workspace state
```

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="No agent injection" icon="approve-check">
    All container setup happens via `docker exec` from the host. Nothing gets
    installed inside your container that you didn't ask for.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docker and Podman" icon="setting">
    Both runtimes are first-class citizens. Auto-detected, configurable via
    `CRIB_RUNTIME`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implicit workspace resolution" icon="magnifier">
    `cd` into a project directory and run commands. crib walks up to find your
    `.devcontainer/` config automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart restart" icon="rocket">
    `crib restart` detects what changed and picks the fastest strategy, from a
    simple restart to a container recreate.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
