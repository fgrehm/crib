## Quick Start

If your project has a `.devcontainer/` directory, you're ready:

```
cd my-project
crib up        # build and start the devcontainer
crib shell     # drop into a shell
crib restart   # restart (picks up config changes)
crib down      # stop and remove the container
```

:::note
`crib` is being developed against **Linux** only. macOS and Windows support may be added if there's interest.

## Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="No agent injection" icon="approve-check">
    All container setup happens via `docker exec` from the host. Nothing gets
    installed inside your container that you didn't ask for.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docker and Podman" icon="setting">
    Both runtimes are first-class citizens. Auto-detected or configurable via
    environment variable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DevContainer Features" icon="puzzle">
    Full support for OCI-based devcontainer features. Install tools like Node,
    Go, or Docker-in-Docker without touching your Dockerfile.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lifecycle hooks" icon="list-format">
    All six devcontainer lifecycle hooks run automatically, from
    `onCreateCommand` through `postAttachCommand`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docker Compose" icon="open-book">
    Multi-service setups work out of the box. crib reads your compose files,
    builds services, and manages the full stack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart restart" icon="rocket">
    `crib restart` detects what changed and picks the fastest strategy, from a
    simple restart to a container recreate.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
